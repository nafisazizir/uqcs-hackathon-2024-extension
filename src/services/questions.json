      "To enforce data integrity"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "To improve performance",
    "explanation": [
      "Database views are primarily used to enhance performance by allowing faster access to data without needing to query the underlying tables directly.",
      "While views can help with data integrity, their main function is not to enforce it but to provide a simplified way to access data.",
      "Views do not store data permanently; they are virtual tables that display data from the underlying tables.",
      "Creating backups is not a function of views; backups are typically handled by database management systems."

      "Security, data integrity, performance"

    "correctAnswer": "Performance, data partitioning, security",
    "explanation": [
      "The three major reasons for using database views are performance, as they allow for faster data access; data partitioning, as they can help manage data visibility; and security, as they can restrict access to sensitive data.",
      "Data redundancy is not a reason for using views; rather, views help reduce redundancy by providing a single point of access to data.",
      "Data integrity is important but is not one of the primary reasons for using views; views are more about how data is accessed and presented."

    "correctAnswer": "A constraint that is always enforced throughout the database's lifetime",
    "explanation": [
      "A static constraint is defined to be true for the entire lifetime of the database, ensuring that the data adheres to certain rules at all times.",
      "Static constraints are not limited to data entry; they are enforced continuously as long as the database exists.",
      "Static constraints cannot be modified at any time; they are meant to provide consistent rules for data integrity.",

    "explanation": [
      "Triggers are designed to automatically execute actions in response to certain events in the database, such as inserting or updating data, which helps enforce constraints.",
      "Triggers do not create backups; that is a separate function typically handled by database management systems.",
      "While triggers can indirectly improve performance by automating tasks, their primary role is not to enhance query performance directly.",
      "Triggers do not manage user permissions; that is typically handled by database security settings."

      "The system ignores existing data",
      "The constraint is disabled temporarily"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "All existing data is checked for compliance",
    "explanation": [
      "When a constraint is enabled with validation, the database checks all existing data against the new constraint to ensure compliance before allowing any further operations.",
      "If only new data were checked, it would not ensure the integrity of the existing data, which is the purpose of enabling with validation.",
      "The system does not ignore existing data; it actively checks it against the constraints when validation is enabled.",
      "Enabling a constraint does not disable it temporarily; it enforces the rules defined by the constraint."

    "correctAnswer": "A constraint that can change based on conditions",
    "explanation": [
      "Dynamic constraints are conditions that can change based on the current state of the database or the data being processed, allowing for more flexible data management.",
      "Static constraints are always true, while dynamic constraints are contingent on specific conditions being met.",
      "Dynamic constraints can be enforced at various levels, not just the database level; they can also apply to specific transactions or operations.",

    "correctAnswer": "It uniquely identifies each record in a table",
    "explanation": [
      "The primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring that no two records can have the same key value, which is essential for data integrity.",
      "The primary key does not allow for duplicate records; that is one of its main functions to ensure uniqueness.",

      "A foreign key is used to establish a link between two tables, allowing for the creation of relationships and ensuring referential integrity between the data.",
      "Foreign keys do not store data permanently; they reference primary keys in other tables to create relationships.",
